  <h1>Sangaku poll help for teachers</h1>
  <br/><br/>

  <p>
  The Sangaku system has a subsystem that can be used to run polls in
  lectures or tutorials.  The intent is similar to that of
  Blackboard's native polling system, TurningPoint etc, but the
  Sangaku-based system has certain advantages.
  </p>

  <h2>Logging in</h2>

  <p>
   SoMaS staff and postgraduates can log in at
   <a href="https://aim.shef.ac.uk/sangaku"><code>https://aim.shef.ac.uk/sangaku</code></a>,
   using their usual university user names and passwords.  The system
   knows all the modules and tutorial groups, and which staff members
   are responsible for which groups.  If you log in at a time when
   there is a session running that you are supposed to be attending,
   then you will automatically be taken to that session.  This also
   works up to 10 minutes before the beginning of the tutorial.  At
   other times, you will see a list of future sessions that you are
   supposed to be attending.
  </p>
  <p>
   Students can also log in at the same URL, and the system will attempt
   to connect them to the right session.  However, this is not totally
   reliable.  For each Sangaku session there is a specific URL like  
   <code>https://aim.shef.ac.uk/sangaku/1234</code>, which can be found
   as explained below; it is safer to give this to the students by email
   or by writing it on the board.  (The SoMaS admin page where you enter
   tutorial attendance also has a button to send email to all members of
   a given tutorial group.)
  </p>

  <h2>The students' point of view</h2>

  <p>
   If a student logs in to a session on their phone while a poll is open,
   they will see something like this.<br/>
   <center>
    <img src="./images/Poll1.png"/>
   </center>
  </p>
  <p>  
   Often, the questions will also be displayed on a projector at the
   front of the room.  Later, after the teacher has decided to reveal
   everything, the bottom of the page will look like this:<br/>
   <center>
    <img src="./images/Poll2.png"/>
   </center>
  </p>
  <p>
   If there are several polls in the same session, they will appear
   and disappear automatically on the student's phone as they are opened
   and closed by the teacher.
  </p>

  <h2>The teacher's point of view</h2>

  <p>
   If you are a teacher and you visit the session monitor page for a
   given session, you will see something like this:<br/>
   <center>
    <img src="./images/Poll3.png"/>
   </center>
   <br/>
   This shows the URL that students should use to access the session
   and any associated polls.  You will generally want to select the
   Polls tab, which might look like this:<br/>
   <center>
    <img src="./images/Poll4.png"/>
   </center>
   <br/>
   This session has only one poll.  If there were more, then the first
   one would be shown in full and the rest would just have a title and
   a circled plus sign that can be used to expand.
  </p>
  <p>
   At the top, there are buttons to select the mode.  Projector mode is
   appropriate if the web page is being shown on a projector and so is
   visible to the students.  Screen mode is appropriate if the web page
   is only visible to you.  Note that you can have the page displayed
   in projector mode on the lectern PC and simultaneously in screen mode
   on your phone if you want.
  </p>
  <p>
   At the bottom, there are buttons to control the state of the poll.
   Hovering over them will provide a little more explanation.  By
   pressing them in sequence you can reveal the questions, then allow
   students to answer, then block further answers, then show how many
   people chose each option, then show which options are correct
   (with explanation, if one has been entered), then make everything
   invisible again.
  </p>

  <h2>The poll creator's point of view</h2>

  <p>This will be written later.</p>
