  <h1>Sangaku help for teachers</h1>
  <br/><br/>

  Sangaku is a system for managing online tutorials.  (The word
  sangaku refers to a kind of Japanese geometrical problem.)  There is
  a <a href="https://youtu.be/KYSYYVwfL5M">demonstration video</a> on
  YouTube.

  <h2>Logging in</h2>
  
  <p>
   SoMaS staff and postgraduates can log in using their usual
   university user names and passwords.  The system knows all the
   modules and tutorial groups, and which staff members are responsible
   for which groups.  If you log in at a time when there is a session
   running that you are supposed to be attending, then you will
   automatically be taken to that session.  This also works up to 10
   minutes before the beginning of the tutorial.  At other times, you
   will see a list of future sessions that you are supposed to be
   attending.
  </p>
  <p>
   Students can also log in at the same URL, but that is not
   recommended.  For each Sangaku session there is a specific URL like
   https&nbsp;://aim.shef.ac.uk/sangaku/1234, which can be found as
   explained below.  Students are expected to log in to Blackboard
   Collaborate first, and you can share the specific URL in the
   Blackboard Collaborate chat; this will avoid confusion between
   different tutorial groups.  You should remember, however, that
   students cannot see chat messages that were posted before they
   logged in, so you should share the URL several times.
  </p>
  
  <h2>The students' point of view</h2>

  <p>
   If a student logs in to a session while it is running, they will see something like this.
   <img alt="Sangaku1.png" src="./images/Sangaku1.png" width="726" height="330">
  </p>
  <p>If they hover over "I am working on this", they will see a menu of options:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>I have finished and am happy with my answer</li>
   <li>I have finished and want to check my answer</li>
   <li>I am stuck and would like some help</li>
   <li>I am stuck and just want to move on</li>
   <li>I want to skip this and try the next question</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
   If they choose an option that indicates that they are ready for the
   next question, then it will be shown.
  </p>

  <p>
   If the student wants to show their work to the tutor, then they can
   click on the obvious button.  They will then see several different
   tabs.
  </p>
  
  <ul>
   <li>
    The first tab shows an editor box in which they can type.  This
    supports LaTeX as well as other standard things like bulleted
    lists, links and so on.
   </li>
   <li>
    The second tab allows them to take a picture of their work with a
    webcam.  (This also supports visualisers, which is not likely to
    be relevant for students, but the same set of options is also
    shown to staff.)
   </li>
   <li>
    The third tab shows a QR code.  Students can scan this with their
    phone, then they will be taken to a page where they can take a
    picture with their phone camera and upload it.  It will then
    automatically appear in the right place in their desktop browser a
    few seconds later.
   </li>
   <li>
    The fourth tab allows for upload of a file stored on the student's PC.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   If a tutor responds to one of these uploads, then the response will
   automatically appear in the right place, and a notification will
   also appear at the top of the student's page.  Staff may also
   respond by speaking through Blackboard Collaborate.  So far we have
   only tried doing this with the tutor speaking to the whole class.
   In principle it would be possible to use breakout rooms or private
   chats to communicate with a subset of students instead.
  </p>
  <p>
   If a student logs in to a session before it is supposed to start,
   they will see a countdown timer.
  </p>

  <h2>The session monitor page</h2>
  
  <p>
   Tutors will primarily use the session monitor page, which looks like this:
   <img alt="Sangaku6.png" src="./images/Sangaku6.png" width="718" height="435">
  </p>
  <p>Selecting the "Monitor" tab shows something like this:
   <img alt="Sangaku7.png" src="./images/Sangaku7.png" width="707" height="334"> 
  </p>
  <p>
   The page updates automatically as new students join the session and
   work through the problems.  Hovering over the icons will show some
   explanation.  For example:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Dan Davis has completed all parts of Q19(c) and is happy with his
    answers.  He is now working on Q18(a).  (This example is taken from
    MAS220, which has a problem booklet; the question numbering follows
    the booklet, and the lecturer specified that Q19(c) should be done
    before Q18 in this session.)
   </li>
   <li>
    Emily Evans skipped over all of Q19(c) and is also working on
    Q18(a) now.
   </li>
   <li>
    Claire Carter is stuck on Q19(c)(i).  The symbol üìù indicates that
    she uploaded something for the tutor(s) to look at, but they have
    not done so yet.
   </li>
   <li>
    Bella Brown has uploaded work for the first three parts of Q19(c),
    and is now working on the fourth part.  The symbol ‚û∞ indicates
    that a tutor has responded to these uploads.  Ideally Bella would
    have updated her status to say whether she was happy with the
    response, which would have changed the icon to a tick or cross,
    but she has not done that.
   </li>
   <li>
    Aaron Anderson is now happy with the first three parts of Q19(c).
    He uploaded something for part (ii), a tutor responded, and he has
    indicated that he understood the response.  He has now uploaded
    something for part (iv) and is waiting for a response on
    that.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   Hovering over a box will give a brief explanation of the icon shown
   there, and will also show the time at which the student last
   interacted with the question.
  </p>
  <p>
   You can click on the "Fake students" button to log in as a fake
   student.  You can stay logged in as a teacher and also have several
   fake student windows open at the same time.  This is a good way to
   understand how the system works.  On the initial fake students
   page, there is a button to tidy things up by deleting all data
   generated by fake students.  Fake students can access sessions at
   any time, whereas real students can only access sessions when they
   are officially running.
  </p>

  <h2>The tutor's response page</h2>

  <p>
   To respond to a student, a tutor can click on a box in the session
   monitor table.  They will then see a page that is quite similar to
   the page that the students see, but with some differences.  They
   have the same upload options that the students have, which they can
   use to upload responses to student queries.  Both the student and
   tutor pages will update automatically in response to actions by the
   other party.
  </p>
  <p>
   If solutions have been entered along with the problem sheet, then
   they will be shown on the tutor response page.  There are
   checkboxes on the monitor tab that can be used to show these
   solutions to students as well.  The solutions will then appear
   automatically alongside the question on the page that students use
   to enter their answers.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Preparation of problem sheets</h2>
  
  <p>
   There is a web interface for entering problem sheets.  It will not
   digest a full LaTeX file.  Instead, you need to click some buttons
   to set up the structure of questions, parts and subparts, and then
   cut and paste fragments of LaTeX.
  </p>
  <p>
   Near the top of the editing page there is a menu item marked
   "Create sessions"
   <br><br>
   <img alt="Sangaku5.png" src="./images/Sangaku5.png" width="712" height="340">
   <br><br>
   This will create a session for this problem sheet for each tutorial
   group.  However, these are all marked as unconfirmed.  Checkboxes
   to confirm them appear in various convenient places.
  </p>

  <h2>Other pages</h2>

  <p>
   There are various housekeeping pages that display lists of modules,
   tutorial groups, sessions, problem sheets and so on.  However, the
   navigation could be improved.
  </p>

  <h2>Things left to do</h2>

  <ul>
   <li>
    There should be a different view that is shown after a session
    closes, showing all the uploads but with the buttons etc
    removed.
   </li>
   <li>
    It should be possible to edit existing uploads, using a web-based
    HTML editor or image editor as appropriate.
   </li>
   <li>
    It should be possible to send a response simultaneously to all
    students, or to copy a response sent to one student and send it to
    another.
   </li>
   <li>
    There should be a better mechanism for uploading images produced
    by a scanning app.  Such apps usually have an option to share the
    scans by email; we could set up a system that receives and
    processes such emails automatically.
   </li>
   <li>
    There should be a system for semiautomatic import of problem
    sheets written in ordinary LaTeX.
   </li>
  </ul>
